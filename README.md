# Road Accident Severity Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict the severity of road accidents using a linear regression model. The model analyzes various factors (independent variables) that influence accident severity (dependent variable) and provides predictions for hypothetical scenarios.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Road.csv`, which contains information about road accidents, including factors like weather conditions, road type, speed limit, and accident severity.

## Files
1. **prac.py**: Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and generate interactive visualizations.
2. **road_accident_model.pkl**: Saved linear regression model for future use.
3. **results.html**: HTML file containing model evaluation metrics.
4. **actual_vs_predicted.html**: Interactive scatter plot comparing actual vs predicted accident severity.
5. **predicted_severity_distribution.html**: Interactive histogram of predicted accident severity.
6. **residual_plot.html**: Interactive residual plot to analyze model performance.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn plotly`.
3. Run `prac.py` to train the model and generate interactive visualizations.
4. Use the saved model (`road_accident_model.pkl`) to predict accident severity for new data.
